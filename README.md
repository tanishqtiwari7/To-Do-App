## üöÄ How to Run (No Setup Required)

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the `bin` folder.
3. Double-click `TO_DO_APP.exe` to launch the app.

> All required files (including SDL2.dll) are included in the `bin` folder. The `dataCenter` folder inside `bin` stores your notes and tasks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building from Source (For Developers)

1. Install a C++ compiler (e.g., MinGW or Visual Studio on Windows, g++ on Linux).
2. Make sure SDL2 development libraries are available in `lib/` and `include/`.
3. Run `make` (or `mingw32-make` on Windows) in the project root directory.

### Example (Windows)

```sh
mingw32-make clean
mingw32-make
cd bin
TO_DO_APP.exe
```

### Example (Linux)

```sh
sudo apt install g++ libsdl2-dev
make clean
make
cd bin
./TO_DO_APP
```
